# Introduction to this Application

This project will focus on building front-end components in React for a simple blogging website. 

A blog post has the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "author": "BatMan",
  "title": "Gothan City safe",
  "excerpt": "Cras in purus eu magna vulputate luctus. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.",
  "date": "1634439025000",
  "image": "http://dummyimage.com/200x134.png/cc0000/ffffff",
  "readingTimeMinutes": 9,
  "tags": ["crypto", "health"]
